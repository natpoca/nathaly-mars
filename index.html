      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Nathaly and I am part of the 2025 Code the Dream cohort.
        I am 25 years old and I have two mini dachshunds that I love so much,
        Canelo and Muneca. I have also recently been promoted to a Project
        Coordinator position at my current company, and I am very proud of that.
